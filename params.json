{"name":"Jware Data Visualization Library","tagline":"An easy to use Java 2d graphics wrapper.","body":"JwareDataVisualizationLibrary\r\n=============================\r\n\r\n\r\nA work in progress library for doing data visualization.\r\n\r\nThe idea here it to allow me to develop my progamming style and to learn more about Java's graphics libraries.  \r\nSo the goal is: I want a way to do simple to moderately complex graphics and animation programs without having to \r\nwrite loads of code to do it. Bascially I'm wrapping up the Java 2D stuff into quick and easy to use package.\r\n\r\nThere are two main classes at this point AbstractGraphicsHanler and its subclass Graphics2DHandler.  There is also \r\nan interface, Drawable.  The idea is to either subclass Graphics2DHandler or use it directly.  You can also use \r\nAbstractGraphicsHandler by utiltizing the Drawable interface, i.e. implement a Drawable and handing it off to the \r\nbase class to process the drawing.  I'm trying to document the package to provide descriptions of whats happening and \r\nso that it's easy to use.  \r\n\r\nIt's kind of messy and has a long way to go to meet my goal of a few lines of code doing lots of cool graphics/ \r\nanimations. So right now the project is in its infancy, I expect it will grow over the next few months, years, \r\ndecades... what I'm saying is that I'm in no real hurry. \r\n\r\nI Code For Fun!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy quick background.  I've been progamming for many many years, but only once professionally.  Starting in 1998\r\nthrough 2005 I did a 3 tiered CRM softare package for a large group of Ford dealers.  There were about 180 dealerships \r\nand around 1500 or so salespeople using the package at it's peak.  The program started out as FordForever and was \r\nultimately renamed CustomerForever. Being involved in Advertising and Graphic design for years, I was a Macintosh \r\nnut.  I also fell in love with Java, coming from C and C++, in my earlier years of progamming.  With that I found a \r\nnice little RAD system called WebObjects from Apple.  It was phenomenal.  It took around 4 months to create the 16K \r\nlines of code and voila, I had a cool, fully functional 3 tiered CRM package that the sales people could use to track \r\nthier prospects.  Alas nothing last Forever - that's funny, but the economy took a dive and my program was liberated \r\nfrom its funding, and it was over.  \r\n\r\nAgain today, I just code for fun!\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
