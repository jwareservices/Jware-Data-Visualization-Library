JwareDataVisualizationLibrary
=============================


A work in progress library for doing data visualization.

The idea here it to allow me to develop my progamming style and to learn more about Java's graphics libraries.  
So the goal is: I want a way to do simple to moderately complex graphics and animation programs without having to 
write loads of code to do it. Bascially I'm wrapping up the Java 2D stuff into quick and easy to use package.

There are two main classes at this point AbstractGraphicsHanler and its subclass Graphics2DHandler.  There is also 
an interface, Drawable.  The idea is to either subclass Graphics2DHandler or use it directly.  You can also use 
AbstractGraphicsHandler by utiltizing the Drawable interface, i.e. implement a Drawable and handing it off to the 
base class to process the drawing.  I'm trying to document the package to provide descriptions of whats happening and 
so that it's easy to use.  

It's kind of messy and has a long way to go to meet my goal of a few lines of code doing lots of cool graphics/ 
animations. So right now the project is in its infancy, I expect it will grow over the next few months, years, 
decades... what I'm saying is that I'm in no real hurry. 

I Code For Fun!


My quick background.  I've been progamming for many many years, but only once professionally.  Starting in 1998
through 2005 I did a 3 tiered CRM softare package for a large group of Ford dealers.  There were about 180 dealerships 
and around 1500 or so salespeople using the package at it's peak.  The program started out as FordForever and was 
ultimately renamed CustomerForever. Being involved in Advertising and Graphic design for years, I was a Macintosh 
nut.  I also fell in love with Java, coming from C and C++, in my earlier years of progamming.  With that I found a 
nice little RAD system called WebObjects from Apple.  It was phenomenal.  It took around 4 months to create the 16K 
lines of code and voila, I had a cool, fully functional 3 tiered CRM package that the sales people could use to track 
thier prospects.  Alas nothing last Forever - that's funny, but the economy took a dive and my program was liberated 
from its funding, and it was over.  

Again today, I just code for fun!
